Hey there! I'm Nanak, an eager web development enthusiast currently diving into JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Advanced Python. I'm actively learning both front-end and back-end development through FreeCodeCamp and Angela Yu's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy.

My GitHub repository is a reflection of my learning journey, featuring projects that showcase my growing skills and dedication. I'm passionate about creating clean, efficient code and building user-friendly applications. I'm on the lookout for internship opportunities to apply my knowledge and gain hands-on experience.
